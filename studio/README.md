# A portfolio starting point for Sanity Studio

This Studio Starter comes with Schemas for projects, blog content, gallery support, collaborators, and more. 


## Running the Studio from the Starter

When you use the 1-click installer, you'll get only what you need for the Studio itself. After you clone it locally, you can run the following commands to get up and running.

```sh
cd studio
